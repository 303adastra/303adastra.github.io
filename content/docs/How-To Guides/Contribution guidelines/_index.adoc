== How to Contribute

We use https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] to format and generate our website, the
https://github.com/google/docsy[Docsy] theme for styling and site structure,
and https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages[GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages] to manage the deployment of the site.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates,
content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation
engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.

== How to write good documentation

There are four types of documentation: https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials[Tutorials], https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/[How-To Guides], https://documentation.divio.com/reference/[References], and https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/#[Explanations].
Consult the https://documentation.divio.com/[The Documentation System] for:

* https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/#how-to-write-good-how-to-guides[How to write good how-to guides]
* https://documentation.divio.com/reference/#how-to-write-good-reference-guides[How to write good reference guides]

== Updating the site

Here's a quick guide to updating the site:

. Fork the https://github.com/303adastra/pid-controlled-clock-drive[PID-controlled clock drive] on GitHub.
. Make your changes and create a pull request (PR).
. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate
  it's a work in progress.
. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with
  the content.
. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any
  "WIP" markers.

== Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

. Click *Edit this page* in the top right hand corner of the page.
. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click *Fork this repository and propose changes* or *Update your Fork* to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
. Follow the rest of the <<updating-the-site,Updating the site>> process to propose your changes.

== Previewing your changes

If you want to preview your changes as you work, you'll need to run your own local Hugo server:

. Follow the instructions in https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/[Getting started] to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You'll need at least *Hugo version 0.68.3*.
  If you install from the https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases[release page],
  make sure you download the `_extended` version which supports SCSS.
. Fork the https://github.com/303adastra/pid-controlled-clock-drive[PID-controlled clock drive] into your own project, then create a local copy using `git clone`. Don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.
+
----
 git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/<your_github_username>/pid-controlled-clock-drive.git
----

. Run `sh serve.sh` in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at `+http://localhost:1313+`. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.
+
----
 sh serve.sh
----

. Follow the rest of the <<updating-the-site,Updating the site>> process to propose your changes.

== Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the https://github.com/303adastra/pid-controlled-clock-drive[PID-controlled clock drive]. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the *Create Issue* button in the top right hand corner of the page.
