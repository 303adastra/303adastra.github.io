The headings in this section have been structured using https://documentation.divio.com/[The Documentation System] by Daniele Procida.

You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the https://docsy.dev/docs/[Docsy User Guide], which lives in the https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide[Docsy theme repo] if you'd like to copy its docs section.

Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the https://docsy.dev/docs/[Docsy User Guide]. You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/[Organizing Your Content].
