[{"content":"Preface Why am I writing this essay? At the time of writing, humanity has endured nothing short of a terrible year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, at the time of writing, humanity is celebrating its 60th anniversity of human spaceflight.[1] An experimental helicopter is about to take first flight on another planet.[2] 42 years from now, perhaps a resident of Bozeman, Montana will construct and successfully test the first warp-capable vessel.[3]\n Given the state of the world, I wanted to take a moment to not only reflect on how far we’ve come, but also collect my thoughts on where we’re headed, and how we might need to course correct.\n    What future should we aspire towards? Gene Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, told actor (now director) Jonathan Frakes, \u0026#34;In the 24th century…​ There will be no hunger, there will be no greed, and all the children will know how to read.\u0026#34;\n Roddenberry’s vision of the future is based on humanism - the philosophy that values and celebrates the best of what humanity can be.[4]\n Gene Roddenberry: The Star Trek Philosophy    It is important that we aspire towards this vision, because as we develop the technological capability to explore the cosmos, it is our morally imperative that we bring with us nothing short of the most admirable traits of humanity.\n What future should we be avoiding? Disney/Pixar’s Wall-E is a masterpiece on sociological story telling. It arguably depicts the most G-rated dystopian vision of the future, in which social systems that favored the rich and were disinterested environmental policies led to a rise in consumerism and a desolate barren planet, whereby the wealthy could flee to outerspace while the impoverished remained on a planet to go extinct.\n Wall-E as Sociological Storytelling    If you’re reading this right now, you’re probably either on a desktop or mobile device. Did you know your device probably contains about 8 grams of cobalt that was likely mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo through exploitation of child labor?[5] Workers throughout the supplychain tech industry have been exploited during the COVID-19 pandemic?[6] Clearly, we’re not living up to Roddenberry’s vision of the future.\n  What are our obligations as citizens of planet Earth? The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known. — Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994.[7]\n Like it or not, we all have a moral imperative to share this rock floating through space, which we call \u0026#34;Earth\u0026#34;.\n    Framing the Problem We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. - Albert Einstein\n The first step in solving any problem is recognizing that there is one. However, we can exercise a \u0026#34;first principles\u0026#34; approach to how we might get there.\n Designing a just society In order to understand complex issues in our current world, we must first understand how societies are built. Consider the following thought experiment…​ You’ve just been elected leader of the new world (congrats!). Your first task on the job is to put in place a set of \u0026#34;fair and just\u0026#34; policies for how society will operate. Where do you start?\n How Do You Design a Just Society? | Thought Experiment: The Original Position    Political philosopher, John Rawls, may argue it is virtually impossible, since creating a completely \u0026#34;fair and just\u0026#34; society will require a \u0026#34;veil of ignorance\u0026#34; of ones personal identity, as to deter bias in the policy formation process.[8] Perhaps you consider the basic needs of a human: food, energy, clean water, garabage management, sewage treatment, and shelter. What would it require to provide every human being with these needs? How do you accommodate for those who have special needs and/or disabilities? What mechanisms will we use to produce and deliver those needs?\n  Designing a post-scarcity society Post-scarcity is a theoretical economic situation in which goods and services that provide basic needs are produced in surplus and distributed with minimal to no human labor.[9][10] The 24th-century society of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine has been labeled a post-scarcity society, due to the ability of the fictional \u0026#34;replicator\u0026#34; technology, with the capability of instantaneously synthesizing almost anything from a ships replicator reserves.[11]\n How Do the Economics of Star Trek Actually Work?       Identifying a Solution In Part 2, we’ll explore some ideas for how we can bring about a post-scarcity future, given the current state of the art.\n If you like this essay and/or would like to contribute feedback on content please feel free to reach out via social media.\n    1. https://yurisnight.net/  2. https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/  3. https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Zefram_Cochrane  4.
