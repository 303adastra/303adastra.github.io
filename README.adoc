= PID-Controlled Clock Drive =

The goal of this project is to provide documentation for building a DIY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drive[clock drive]
for controlling an equatorial-mounted telescope,
using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock[real-time clock] driven https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller[PID controller] for celestial tracking.
